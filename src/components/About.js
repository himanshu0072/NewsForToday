          Text Master is a project to provide as many online computer utilities
          (tools) to all users around the world as possible. The use of
          utilities is and will be free of charge. These utilities can be
          considered as accessories to Online Operating Systems (such as Chrome
          OS). The founder of Text Master is Mladen Adamovic. Email:
          himanshupr7@gmail.com This website started in December 2022. In
          January 2023, the website was updated with the second version of the
          software, making the website fully compliant with the Chrome Browser.
          When we get a new good idea we like for any type of online computer
          program we will try to implement it. So you might contact us if you
          have an idea for any online utility. But, remember, this site is
          pointless if people don't know about it. So, if you do like the site
          or any particular utility on the site, you might help us in some of
          the following ways :
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you have your own websites you might put the link to our site or
            particular utility. We prefer the link to a particular utility from
            related pages. For example, if you have site about English language
            we would prefer a link to the English language utilities
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are a journalist, writer or you have your own blog, you could
            write the article about our site
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell your friends or colleagues about the site or particular
            utility, if you think that they might be interested in them
          </li>
        </ol>
