          January 2023, the website was updated with the second version of the
          software, making the website fully compliant with the Chrome Browser.
          When we get a new good idea we like for any type of online computer
          program we will try to implement it. So you might contact us if you
          have an idea for any online utility. But, remember, this site is
          pointless if people don't know about it. So, if you do like the site
          or any particular utility on the site, you might help us in some of
          the following ways :
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you have your own websites you might put the link to our site or
            particular utility. We prefer the link to a particular utility from
            related pages. For example, if you have site about English language
            we would prefer a link to the English language utilities

            If you are a journalist, writer or you have your own blog, you could
            write the article about our site
